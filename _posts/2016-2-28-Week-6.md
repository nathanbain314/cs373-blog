###February 22 through 26###
###Past week ###
This past week we learned quite a bit about passing values into functions. On Monday we went over the several ways to do this and what each one required. We learned about using the position, the name, iterables, and unpacking dictionaries. On Wednesday a guest speaker came in and talked to us about opensource mobile development, and how that differs from closed source development. On Friday we focused more on actual functions and how to pass values into it. 

###Challenges###
I didn't really have many problems or challenges this past week. My biggest challenge would be the daily quizzes on Canvas. I've gotten better at them and I've looked over my notes before taking it, but I still lose several points on them.

###Next week###
I'm going spend as much of next week as I can studying for my two tests. The tests are on Canvas, which concerns me since I haven't been doing as well as I want to, but I'll be spending more time studying for these, so hopefully I'll do well. I'm going to make sure that my notesheet is full of enough information as well as organized so that I'm not spending the test finding the notes. 

###Tip of the week###
Before you take a test, make sure that you are well rested, you've eaten enough meals in the day, and you are not too stressed out.
