title: Week 10
---

###March 28 through April 1###
###Past week ###
n Monday we got the instructions for IDB2 and started working on that. We went over concepts of sql  and on Wednesday had a guest speaker from Atlassian. On Friday we had learned about regular expressions. I've used regular expressions a few times before but I've never taken the time to really learn it, so this was helpful.

###Challenges###
Docker was a bit difficult this time around, and many things didn't work with it, but we've gotten through most of our problems. 

###Next week###
Next week we will finish up our project and submit it. I've got another project, a test and some math homework, but I hope to get through everything. 

###Tip of the week###
[grep](http://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) is an incredibly useful tool for searching through your machine for files that contain text. If you find that compiling results in an error for some function, you could run 
grep “function” ./ -nr
and that would tell the file and line number of where it was located.
