title: Week 5

###February 15 through 19###
###Past week ###
Last week my teammate and I were able to get the bulk of the Netflix project done, so this week we mostly had to optimizedthe assignment to have an RMSE of less than 1.00, and then less than 0.95. We  got our final solution working on Monday, and had enough time to work on trying new types of caches. In class we learned about lambdas, maps, and generators and how to use them. 

###Challenges###
I haven't had very much experience with writing in python, so this project was a learning experience. The other problem was just thinking of how to use the Netflix data in order to predict how a user would rate something. I haven't taken a statistics class in over a year and a half. 

###Next week###
Next week I going catch up on the reading, and then I might start studying for this test. The test sounds like it might be difficult since there is so much material, and I haven't done very well on the canvas quizzes. Furthermore, the tests are worth a large part of the overall score. Each one is worth more that all of the quizzes combined, and more than three projects combined.

###Experience so far###
I've thought that the project was pretty interesting. It was challenging, but also interesting. The first project was helpful in making me learn about setting up the project environment so that this most of the work on this project could just be dedicated to the actual project.

###Tip of the week###
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is a simple command line graphing tool. It might take a few hours of playing around with to learn how to use, but it is very useful. It is fast and easy to use once you learn it. You are in control of as much of it as you want to be, and because of this it can be used to create consistent graphs. A configuration file can be created to save your settings for a graph. It can be useful if you want a user generated graph on a website, since the commands can be called with a php file.
I found that it was quite useful for this past Netflix project, since we had so much data, but the only visibly useful data was an RMSE at the end of the output, even though we had over a million estimations to use, millions of data from caches, and tons of raw data from the training data. I quickly found out that just the estimations were too much for Excel or the Linux equivalent to  handle, both in actual limit of number of data points and in computation power. It took gnuplot a couple of seconds generate the graph below, which plots the actual value, the user average, movie average, standard deviation range, and the estimated value. It doesn't look too useful, but it did allow us to see some trends in our estimation, and what weights had the most effect on our estimation, and where our estimation seemed to be the most incorrect. The great thing was that when we wanted to try some new data, the configuration file was saved, so it only took another couple of seconds to render the graph out.
