title: Week 11

###April 4 through 8###
###Past week ###
Last week we learned more about SQL queries and how to use them. My team and I worked on the website and getting it to work with all of our data. It was difficult because much of what we used was new to me and it was a challenge getting everything to work together.

###Challenges###
Docker and Carina are difficult to set up and get working. Docker is simple enough, but I always manage to keep getting more and more errors as I try to fix previous ones. Carina was having a ton of problems, and I could not use any new cluster that I created after the beginning of the week. Luckily we still had the master node that we had the website created on, though it was disconcerting knowing that if we broke this cluster we wouldnâ€™t have any more to use. Other people were apparently having the same problems that we were having, and it must be a problem with Carina because they are rebooting all of the clusters on Tuesday, so hopefully we can get more clusters then.

###Next week###
Next week I am going to start on the last portion of this project. I don't have as much other school work to do these two weeks, so hopefully we can get this done easily enough. 

###Tip of the week###
If you find a table of data online and would like to retrieve it in a more useful format, [this tool](http://www.convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm) converts tables to csv given a URL, and [this tool](http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm) converts csv files to json.
