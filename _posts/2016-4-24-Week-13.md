###April 18 through 22###
###Past week ###
In class this week we learned about overriding methods and inheriting methods from parent classes. We  finished the search over the weekend, which left very little to work on during the week. There were still some things that we had to sort out during the week but we got it working and submitted on time. 

###Challenges###
I had to use a large amount of JavaScript for the first time in a while this past week and realized how much I've forgotten. I've only used JavaScript sparingly to create small programs but now I had to use it sort results of our entire database for a  user experience. 

###Next week###
Next week I'll need to work on the presentation material for the project, and then I have some more projects that I need to work on, and then I need to study for the test the following week.

###Tip of the week###
When writing a bash script ! gets the PID of the last command, which allows you to check the status of that command.       
'
./FirstProgam &     
FirstProgramPid=$!     
./SecondProgram &     
SecondProgramPid=$!     
wait $FirstProgramPid      
kill $SecondProgramPid     
'
This code will wait for the first program to finish and will then kill the second program.
