###February 7 through 11###
###Past week ###
Last week we learned about the project that we will be working on for the next several weeks until the end of the semester. My partner and I managed to get a team early and started working on it by Tuesday. On Wednesday someone from RackSpace came to our class and told us how to create an account with them and use their cluster for our website. 

###Challenges###
Almost everything in this project is new to me, so my challenge this past week was learning a little of everything. Luckily a large group means that we can split up the work and learn a few things about everything and everything about a few things. 

###Next week###
Next week I'm going to look over the project more and try to work on what I can so that we can complete everything by Thursday. 

###Tip of the week###
Makefiles are extremely useful when creating a project, but it seems that many people still don't use them. I found that [this book](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf) was pretty good, but there are many more resources that can be found by just googling. Just including a simple makefile with one compilier command can save a good deal of time and typing, and more complex ones can include many other useful commands as well which all save time.
