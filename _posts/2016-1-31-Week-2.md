###January 25 through 29###
###Past week ###
On Monday I learned more about the Collatz project, which was useful since I was a little confused about it over the weekend. I programmed more on the project, but have not yet optimized it yet. I learned about the different methods of testing code and their problems as well

###Challenges###
I've barely programmed in python at all previous to this class. I tried a little just to learn it, and wrote a few scripts for Blender, but other than that I had not touched it. Learning it and writing code in it has been one of the more difficult aspects of this class, but I am slowly getting a hang of it. 

###Next week###
Since the project is due on Thursday, I am going to finish the project this week. I will try to plan on finishing Tuesday or Thursday so that I will have extra overflow time, and so that I will be able to go over all the requirements and test it extensively. I will spend some time checking for all of the required parts so that I don't lose points, or get the project docked a day late for incompleteness.

###Experience so far###
I am enjoying this class so far, and think I will learn quite a bit about it in the next semester.

###Tip of the week###
Read all of the assigned readings since they are on the quizzes. The questions about them are really easy if you do the reading, but confusing if you haven't.
